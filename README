Work in progress

----------

Anatomy of a module:

/modules/<module_name>/

    __init__.py: Import the module from module.py.

    module.py: File name can be whatever you like; must provide a Blueprint.
        static_folder should be 'static/c' and static_url_path MUST be
        '/static', otherwise auto-loading the module's assets will not work.

    /static/: Directory containing static files (JS, CSS, images). In the root
        (or subdirectories) you should place your source static files. You will
        want to compile them using Gulp and output them to directory 'c' (see
        below).

        /c/: Compiled assets. These will be served and used. They must be
            named like so:

            module.js: The module's JS file.

            module.css: The module's CSS file.
