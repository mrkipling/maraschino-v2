Anatomy of a module:

/modules/<module_name>/

        __init__.py: Import the module from module.py.

        module.py: File name can be whatever you like; must provide a Blueprint.
                   static_folder should be 'static/c' and static_url_path MUST
                   be '/static/modules/<blueprint_name>', otherwise
                   auto-importing the module's assets will not work.

        /static/: Directory containing static files (JS, CSS, images) - files in
                  this directory are ignored apart from what is served in /c/
                  (see below). If you have a complex module you could create
                  multiple JS and CSS files here and create a gulpfile to
                  compile them and output to /c/.

                  /c/: Compiled assets'; must contain both:

                       module.js: The module's JS file

                       module.css: The module's CSS file
