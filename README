Work in progress

----------

Anatomy of a module:

/modules/<module_name>/

    __init__.py: Import the module from module.py.

    module.py: File name can be whatever you like; must provide a Blueprint.
        static_folder should be 'static/c' and static_url_path MUST be
        '/static', otherwise auto-loading the module's assets will not work.

    /static/: Directory containing static files (JS, CSS, images).

        /js/: Source JS files. Will be compiled automatically when running gulp.
            Make sure that you compile assets before distributing a module. For
            now, only one source JS file is supported and it must be called
            module.js.

        /less/: Source LESS files. Will be compiled automatically when running
            gulp. Make sure that you compile assets before distributing a
            module. For now, only one source LESS file is supported and it must
            be called module.less.

            /c/: Compiled assets. Will be compiled automatically for each module
                when running gulp, which will output the following two files
                (both must be present):

                module.js: The module's JS file.

                module.css: The module's CSS file.
